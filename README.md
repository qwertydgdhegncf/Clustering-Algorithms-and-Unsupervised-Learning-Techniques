# Clustering-Algorithms-and-Unsupervised-Learning-Techniques
Explores nine unsupervised ML techniques: K-Means (from scratch), GMM, DBSCAN (PyCaret), and Anomaly Detection (PyOD). Focuses on advanced applications like Time-series clustering (DTW/K-Shape) and clustering high-dimensional vector embeddings derived from LLMs for documents, images, and audio.
